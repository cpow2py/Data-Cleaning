# Data-Cleaning
Without clean/meaningful data which an algorithm or model understand makes a Data Scientist a powerless. So, Data Cleaning is first stage of machine learning/data mining in any standard process data mining frameworks like KDD, CRISP-DM and SEMMA. Here in this repository, I will demonstrate all the data preprocessing features in Python Code.

Here in this Project of data cleaning. A dataset from Kaggle was taken into consideration and we are not purely building a model regarding that dataset. We find the dependent and independent variables from the data set and clean the data, some of the errors are created to make a live change to it

# Data Cleaning/ Data Preprocessing 
1. Import the Required Libraries.
2. Load the dataset into a dataframe.
3. Extract the required Independent and dependent variables from the dataset.
4. Dealing with Missing Data.
5. Removing Outliers.
6. Encoding Categorical Variables/Data(only if the variables are dependent or independent for final outcome).
7. Feature Scaling(Normalization)(In Scikit-learn only some algorithms require Scaling Eg : SVM).
8. Sampling the data into Training set and Testing set.

These are the things to be taken care of in the process of data Cleaning
